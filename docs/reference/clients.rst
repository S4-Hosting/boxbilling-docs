Clients management
====================

All client management is done via the *Administration area > Clients* section.

Add a new client
--------------------------------------------

You can add new clients manually via *New Client* tab (you will need to enter 
the client details by hand on such a case), or your clients are automatically 
created if you add a Client registration form on your website. The latter is 
provided by the BoxBilling software automatically and can be found under 
yourdomain.com/billing/ (if you installed BoxBilling to this folder).

Check existing clients
--------------------------------------------

You can check existing clients by pressing *Clients > Overview*, where your latest 
clients are listed. If you already have a lot of clients and need to find a 
specific one, you can perform a search via *Clients > View (search) clients* tab.

Client details can be checked and edited by clicking on the Client line listed 
on the *Overview* or *View (search) clients* tab.

Editing client details
--------------------------------------------

In the client Details page, you can perform these actions:

* Edit personal information via the *Personal* tab.
* Add funds to your client balance via the *Balance* tab.
* Generate and check Client invoices via the Invoices tab.
* Check the accounts the client has under the *Accounts tab* (same goes for other products a client has ordered via *Domains* *Downloads* and *Licenses* tabs).
* The *Support* tab is used to check the tickets this client has submitted to your help desk (you can quickly open a ticket and send a reply via clicking on it in the ticket list). Also you can generate a new ticket for the client by pressing *Add new ticket*.
* You can conveniently check the IP / Country this client has logged in from via the *History* tab. This information is useful when a client believes that his account was overtaken by malicious user and you need to verify this. Most of the time a client logs in from the same country / IP, however if the account is overtaken you will see a different IP and country in the *History* tab.
* The *Emails* tab shows all the e-mails that were sent to the client. If a client claims that he has not received some of the e-mails shown in the list you can click the e-mail in question and verify when it was sent in the pop up window. Also notice the *Resend* button which can be used to resend the e-mail to the client inbox.

Removing a client
--------------------------------------------
Go to "Clients -> Overview", click on the line with client name. Client details will appear and on the bottom of the page there is a link called "Delete client".
